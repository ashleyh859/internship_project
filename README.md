# 🎓 Data Analytics Project for Educational Empowerment: Uncovering Engagement Patterns at a Nonprofit 💡

## 🎯👋 Introduction and Project Objective

This was the first data analytics project that I've ever created after learning some SQL, Excel, and Tableau skills. While working as an Administrative Assistant and a Marketing/Public Relations intern since last summer and during the school year and even as a participant in this program myself, I wanted to create a project that could seek potential patterns of student engagement levels in this Program which could provide valuable insights to improving the program services. The primary focus is to understand how different factors such as colleges, grade levels, and more correlate with student engagement. 

This nonprofit organization empowers low-income and/or first-generation students, who face significant challenges in accessing higher-level education, with resources and support to succeed in receiving their secondary degrees. It provides opportunities like one-on-one counseling, assistance with financial aid, and more throughout their journey. This program starts with the Access Program, which helps students apply to secondary education, and then to the Success Program, which supports students during their college time. 

## ❓📋Project Questions

1. What proportion do the categories in the program take up between Active and Inactive Participants?
  
2. Is there a correlation between grade levels and the level of engagement in our support programs?
  
3. How does the proportion of Active and Inactive Participants change among different colleges?
   
4. Does attendance at the Success Orientation positively impact students' ongoing engagement?
  
5. Does a student's financial gap influence the student's engagement level?

## Key Skills Used 🛠️
### • Data Cleaning and Data Exploration with Microsoft SQL 🔍
### • Excel (Pivot Table) and Tableau for Data Visualization Dashboards 📊


## 🧹🔍 Data Cleaning

• Data Manipulation Language (DML): Utilized UPDATE statements to modify existing data and set missing values to specific default values when creating new columns.

• Data Definition Language (DDL): Used ALTER TABLE and DROP COLUMN statements to add and drop columns, removing confidential information and unnecessary columns.

• Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used SQL functions like REPLACE, PARSENAME, and CONCAT to reformat and extract existing data to standardize GPA values and classify college types into distinct categories (Public/Private).

• Conditional Logic and Data Filtering: Utilized CASE statements to categorize data and filter rows based on specific conditions, such as identifying transfer status and distinguishing active and inactive participants.

## 🔍📊 Data Exploration

• Data Manipulation Language (DML): Utilized SQL functions such as COUNT, SUM, and CASE to categorize students as active or inactive participants based on their program type

• Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used CASE statements to categorize students into distinct engagement levels

• Conditional Logic and Data Filtering: Filtered data based on program participation, engagement levels, attendance at Success Orientation, and financial gap
